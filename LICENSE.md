# Lawn Buddy - The Learning & Laughter License

Copyright (c) 2025 [Your Name/Organization Here]

This license governs the use of "Lawn Buddy" (the "Software") for specific, delightful purposes.

## 1. Permitted Uses (Serious & Scholarly)

You are hereby granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software for:

*   **Learning:** To understand its inner workings, marvel at its code, and expand your programming knowledge.
*   **School Projects:** To demonstrate concepts, complete assignments, or impress your educators.
*   **Personal Use:** To manage your own virtual lawn care empire, or simply enjoy its presence on your machine.

**Important Note for Permitted Uses:** For these purposes, no modifications to the original Software are permitted. Admire it as it is, in its pristine, unadulterated form.

## 2. Permitted Uses (Comical & Hilarious)

Should you wish to employ the Software for purposes of jest, parody, or outright comedic absurdity, you are enthusiastically encouraged to do so, provided you adhere to the following:

*   **Major Transformation Required:** Any derivative work intended for comical use MUST undergo significant and unmistakable changes in its visual presentation. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   **Look:** Drastically alter the overall aesthetic. Think polka dots, neon green, or a complete visual overhaul.
    *   **Colors:** Employ a palette so garish or mismatched that it could only be intentional.
    *   **Logos:** Replace all original logos with something undeniably silly, perhaps a dancing garden gnome or a lawnmower wearing a tiny hat.
    *   **Name:** Rename the Software to something entirely different and clearly humorous (e.g., "Grass Giggles," "Turf Tickler," "The Mowing Mirth Machine").

The goal here is to ensure that no reasonable person could confuse your comical creation with the original, serious "Lawn Buddy" Software. We encourage maximum hilarity and minimal brand confusion.
